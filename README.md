 I could have aligned the UI better and tried to solve the issue with the sound as
 there is a bit of a delay with it. I used a singleton, but I feel like I could have
 approached it with a more efficient method. I designed the gameplay to be very simple
 so the kids won't struggle with it. I made it easy for kids to understand the game by 
 displaying everything they need to know on the home screen.
 
How to play:

Left/Right Arrow: Move left and right
Up Arrow: Move up
Escape: Quit Game

Win and Lose condition:

I did not have enough time to create a win and lose screen.
The game restarts whether you win or lose.
